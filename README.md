Very simple react project skeleton that utilizes webpack with webpack dev server<br>
to transpile typescript/TSX and SCSS files to a bundle and automatically <br>
refreshes the local server on changes. 

To start server and listen for changes: <br>
$ npm start	<br>
Browser window to: http://localhost:3000/
